Api-Module
This is the main module that all the requests go through then it communicates with the prespective services. 
The api-service module is a flask api that can be easily modify.

Person-Module
The person-sevice module is a flask-api that communicates with the Api-service and the database. 
The flexibility of flask makes it easy to query and input person into the db.

Location-Module
The location-service module is a grpc server that communicates with the Api-service and the database. 
I belive that GRPC will help improve latency in searching and query for multiple locations.

Connection-Module
The connection-service module is a kafka consumer that listens for the Api connection messages. Kafka will help scale to multiple containers to make the necessary calculations if traffic increases.
